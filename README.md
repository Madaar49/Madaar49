# About me

Hello there! I am Augustine Maada Gbondo, with a Master's degree in Tropical Hydrogeology and Environmental Engineering from Technische Universitaet Darmstadt. I am currently a “Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter” employed by Technische Universität Darmstadt, working at [HLNUG](https://www.hlnug.de). This site is predominantly for showcasing my projects, version control and collaboration with peers. Since 2014, I have been active in the water and environmental sector, started using python in 2021. In addition I also leverage GIS and Data Science as tools for water, environmental and general geoscience tasks. For more information please see [my personal website](https://gbondo-am.github.io). 
  
## Interest
Hydrogeology and Environmental Engineering, Computational Geoscience, Hybrid-models, and application of Machine Learning & Deep Learning to these domains.

**Projects I am currently working on/interested are listed below.**

***HydroChemPy :*** A python package for calculating and processing hydrochemical data. Standalone app or integration as a toolbox into ArcGisPro

***BlockCVPy :*** A package to perform spatial cross validation in python. Integration to the Sk-Learn package. Collaborators are welcomed.

## Contact
I am open to opportunities for collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via my contacts at the side bar of this site. My research repos are private until need to make them public, however feedbacks on my public repos and projects are always welcome.
